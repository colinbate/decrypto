# Decryptoquote

This is a tool to assist with solving Cryptoquotes.

## History

I originally wrote this in vanilla JS with a PHP backend in 2005/2006. As with many of my toy projects, I like to re-invent them to play with new technologies. In this case, Mithril and Redux in 2016.

The code here is actually a combination of both versions.
